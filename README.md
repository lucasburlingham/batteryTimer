# batteryTimer
Windows Batch script to test how long the battery lasts on a laptop. Python script does about the same thing, and is written in Python 3 for more compatibility.


**Concept: **
*Display text telling the user that the script is running. Similar to the green lighning bug in Unix.
*Log (append) text with current time to a file in temporary or user-accessable folder for review later.
*Wait 2 minutes
*log to file again
*repeat until computer dies from powerloss.
